  <p>I have recently completed my Master’s in Mechanical Design from IIT Delhi.
    I am interested in obtaining a faculty position,
    where I can contribute my knowledge on engineering education and lead campus and professional service activities.
    During my Master’s, I was fortunate enough to have served as a teahing assistant and occasionally substitute
    lecturer for an intermediate-level course on Machine Design and Vibration Analysis. I found that
    my professional experience as an engineer provided me with a broad view that assists students with projects and assignments.</p>
